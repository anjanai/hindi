<h3> More on the oddball &#2352;: <b> the vowel &#2315 and  the &#2371; matra </b></h3>
<P>Points to remember:
<ol>
<li> The &#2371; is a matra, and all matras are associated with vowels. This matra is associated with the vowel
&#2315 - Hindi speakers pronounce this vowel exactly like you would pronounce &#2352;&#2367;.
<li>An interesting point (especially for parents) is that this letter is <i>supposed</i> to be pronounced very differently
in Sanskrit - my research tells me that to say &#2315 you have to roll your tongue and say a long  <i>rrrr</i> like you were
saying the English word <i>work</i>, stretching out the <i>r</i> a bit: <i>worrrrrk</i>.
<li>We will stick to the &#2352;&#2367; pronunciation of &#2315 as that is how the Hindi experts pronounce it.
<li> The &#2371; matra is written by writing a small C-shaped hook at the bottom of the letter. Examples :
&#2325;&#2371; &#2346;&#2371; &#2335;&#2371; &#2344;&#2371; &#2340;&#2371; &#2332;&#2371; &#2360;&#2371;
<li> For the letter &#2361;, this is how you add the matra: &#2361;&#2371;.
<li> For the letter &#2342;, I have always written it with a hook below the letter, but this is how it shows up on the computer:
&#2342;&#2371; (you write only half the &#2342;, and then add the hook.)
<li> The &#2371; matra is similarly pronounced: if you see a &#2325;&#2371;, say it exactly like you would say &#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;.
&#2346;&#2371; is said like &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;.

<h3>Letter recognition practice: &#2346; &#2347; &#2398; &#2348; &#2349; &#2350;. Note the difference between &#2347; and &#2398; (ph and f).</h3>
Note: The &#2398; sound came to us from the Persian language (it did not exist in Sanskrit). 
All words in Hindi which contain the &#2398; sound SHOULD be written with a dot under the &#2347;, but in reality,
even the Hindi textbook writers don't enforce that. Today, it seems to be quite acceptable to write the &#2398; as a &#2347; 
(without the dot) - nobody seems to notice the difference - almost everybody pronounces the word as they think it should sound like 
(sometimes with a <b>ph</b> sound, more often with a <b>f</b> sound) - irrespective of the fact that there is (or isn't) a dot there.
For these exercises, however, make the difference obvious when you say &#2398; and &#2347;.
